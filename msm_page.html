<h3>About Us</h2>
<p  class="about">Mizzou Student Media is the official student media 
  for the University of Missouri and operates independently 
  from the student government, the School of Journalism and
   any other campus entity. MSM officially formed in 2019, 
   under the supervision of our coordinator, Becky Diehl. 
   Prior to this, the three outlets operated separately, 
   with little communication or collaboration. Now, these 
   outlets interact regularly, with many students choosing 
   to work for multiple outlets at once. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Our three outlets are the only newsrooms at Mizzou that 
  are entirely led and run by students. Diehl is the only 
  full-time staff member working for Mizzou Student Media, 
  all other work is done by students. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Mizzou Student Media is governed by an executive board,
   made up of the two people who lead each outlet, along 
   with the General Manager of Mizzou Student Media. MSM 
   also has a team of students who work outside of the outlets’ 
   editorial processes and work to support and guide the outlets.
    This team was a new creation, started in 2021 by Sydney Lewis,
     the first General Manager of Mizzou Student Media. The team 
     works to promote innovation and push for new ways to reach our audience.

  <h5>Mentorship</h5>

  <p>
    Our mentorship program aims to connect 
    current students with our alumni who work
     at publications like The New York Times, 
     CNN, NPR and more. Students can get insight 
     from feedback on their content to long-term 
     career advice. Staff members have the benefit
      of gaining insight from people who have been
      in their shoes and are role models for career
       achievement.

  <h5>Training</h5>

  <p>
    Mizzou Student Media hosts 1-2 workshops
     per month for staff to learn from alumni
      and industry professionals. These 
      opportunities support the hands-on work 
      our staff does at each of our student-led
       outlets. We utilize our vast alumni network
        to provide students with connections and
         learning opportunities they can’t get 
         anywhere else.

  <h5>Community</h5>
  <p>
    None of our outlets can 
    function without community. 
    To support this goal, we offer
     monthly social events for staff 
     to get to know each other and 
     immerse themselves in the campus 
     community. These opportunities also 
     extend to intramural sports teams
