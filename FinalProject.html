    Crash Course: P Values
</p>
<p class="quote">
    "Comparing children under five years of age with elevated lead levels for about the same duration of time pre-water switch, the percentage increased from 1.5 percent to 8.5 percent.
</p>
<p class="quote">
  The p value was 0.007." (Hanna-Attisha, 141)
</p>
<p>
    What is a "p value" exactly? Well, I'll let Dr. Mona explain.
</p>
<p class="quote">
    "In statistics, the "p value" shows the statistical signifiance. And the lower the p value, the stronger the significance.
</p>
<p class="quote">
Anything less than 0.05 is significant. There it was.
</p>
<p class="quote">
Lead. It was real.
</p>
<p class="quote">
The impact was there in the numbers." (Hanna-Attisha, 142)
</p>
<p>
    To add on to Dr. Mona's definition, a p value gives the percent chance that an event, often it is a comparison of amounts or proportions, of a given magnitude, or one more extreme, could place as a result of random chance. 
    The world is not perfect, and there is natural variation to all things that happen. 
</p>  
<p>
    Once this probability is calculated, it is compared to an alpha value, or the level of significance. The most common alpha value is 0.05, which is what Dr. Mona used in her research.
    Like Dr. Mona said, if the p value is lower than the significance level, it is deemed to be "statistically significant," and is considered hard proof of the existence of a relationship between two variables.
</p>
<p>
    In the case of Flint, this was used to prove the existence of a link between the switch to Flint River and an increase in the amount of lead in the blood of Flint's children.

    Changes observed inside Flint city limits saw statistically significant increases in elevated blood lead levels (EBLL) at significance 0.05. Percentage is the portion of children that had EBLL before and after the water source was changed to the Flint River.
    
    Additionally, areas within Flint that had high water lead levels (WLL), naturally, also saw statistically significant increases in EBBL.
</p>
<p>
    In short this means that the rise in cases of EBLL in Flint, Michigan from before to after the switching of the water source was so large that there was less than a 5% chance of seeing a shift of that magnitude, or one more extreme, occur naturally as a result of random chance.

<p>
    Dr. Mona's research also looked into the levels of lead in the water throughout Flint, and broke down the water testing results by ward. The EPA's Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) for lead is 15 parts per billion (ppb).
</p>
<p>
    Wards 5, 6 and 7 were hit the hardest by the lead contamination, and saw the highest percentage of homes with samples over the MCL. Wards 2 and 9 saw the highest percentage of samples that showed minimal levels of lead,
    but these levels did not have the same concentration as some of the other wards.

<p>
    Comparison of pollution levels in Flint, Hinkley and Woburn compared to the EPA MCL for their respective contaminant. Woburn, MA had over 50 times the EPA limit for Trichloroethylene, as a result of the pollution from  Beatrice Foods and W. R. Grace and Company.
