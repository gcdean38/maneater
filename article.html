<h1>Seven Maps to Visualize the 2020 Presidential Election</h1>
<p width="730px">After over two weeks of counting ballots, the results of the 2020 Presidential Election are starting to settle. Former Vice President Joe Biden defeated incumbent President Donald J. Trump by a margin of 306-232 in the Electoral College. Here is a look at six maps that will help breakdown the results of the most recent election.</p>

<p>One major factor contributing to Vice President Biden’s victory was a growing national dissatisfaction with the Trump presidency, primarily in its response and handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. Forty-two states plus Washington, D.C. saw a leftward shift during this cycle, most notably Georgia, Arizona, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. These five states combined for 73 electoral votes, and went blue after going for President Trump four years ago. One key state that did not move left was Florida, which saw Hispanic voters break towards the President at a higher rate than they did during his first run for Commander-in-Chief. That being said, one key factor in this leftward shift was a spike in turnout across the country.</p>

    Nationally, there were roughly 22 million more ballots cast in 2020 than in 2016, which shakes out to an increase in turnout of approximately 7.2 percent. This was especially apparent in states like Hawai’i, Arizona, Montana and Washington State where turnout jumped over 10.5% from 2016. Increases in turnout were highly correlated with mail-in ballot returns as a percent of the state vote four years ago.

    In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, many states allowed their citizens to vote by mail to avoid going out in public and putting both themselves, and their communities, in danger. Universal mail-in voting had already been instituted in several states prior to this election cycle, and some of these states saw their 2016 turnout matched through mail-in voting alone. One of the key states to see a large increase in turnout through mail-in voting was Colorado. The Centennial State had been a battleground state for several cycles, with President Barack Obama winning in closely contested races in 2008 and 2012, before Secretary of State Hillary Clinton won by 5 points in 2016. During the 2020 Election, however, Vice President Biden blew the race open, winning by approximately 13.5% on the tail of a statewide shift of 8.59 points, in favor of the Democrats. Furthermore, on the topic of mail-in voting, are numbers surrounding the return rate for ballots.

    While there were an abundance of mail-in ballots requested, not all voters returned their ballots. In fact, the rate at which ballots were returned showed negative correlations with mail-in ballot turnout compared to 2016. This suggests that places where ballots were returned at a high frequency likely requested fewer ballots and had more people vote on Election Day. This is linked directly to the next phenomenon called cannibalization, or the percent of ballots that were cast before Election Day.

<p>
    As one would imagine, the closer to the 2016 turnout levels a state reached during early/mail-in voting, the higher the cannibalization rate for that state. The meaning of this? Vote by mail efforts did not actually increase the number of new potential voters, but rather had those prospective voters cast their ballots earlier, like an advance on a paycheck.

    Following Amy Coney Barrett’s confirmation to the Supreme Court of the United States that saw many Senate Republicans backtrack on the precedent set four years prior, Democrats were hoping to take back control of the US Senate to avoid the possibility of another conservative justice finding a seat on the highest bench in the land. With many Republicans facing tough reelection opponents while simultaneously managing the news coverage that has come from their unwavering support for the increasingly unpopular President Trump, the 2020 election cycle seemed to be the opportunity for which the DNC had been waiting. Ultimately, nearly all of the Republican incumbents won back their seats, only losing two, in Arizona and Colorado, while picking up a seat in Alabama, with two races in Georgia still outstanding. When compared to the top of the ticket, Democratic candidates were outperformed by a margin of 1.1 percentage points.

    One of the possible reasons for this? An overreliance on polling. While polling is not doomed or the bane of all evil, as some Twitter inhabitants may want to propagate, there is no doubt that it has an effect on the psyche of a potential voter. In regards to the Biden vs Trump race, states where FiveThirtyEight’s final polling average was within 5 points had a mail-in ballot return rate over 7.5% higher than states who’s polling average was greater than 20 points. Additionally, similar to the 2016 presidential election, polls tended to favor Democrats, and overestimate their performances. On average, President Trump won states by 1.1 percentage points, while the polls gave Biden an average of a 4.6 percentage point advantage.
